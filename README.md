## Bottom Browser

This is a [Brackets](http://brackets.io) extension for browsing sites within Brackets. Some sites won't load because of [X-Frame-Options HTTP response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/X-Frame-Options?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=The_X-FRAME-OPTIONS_response_header) and what not. Flash won't work either.
